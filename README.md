# Grid Maker

Contains code for generating grids from the "Fundamerntals of Grid Generation" book by Patrick Knupp and Stanly Steinberg.

Based on boundaries, most of the grids from the appendix of the book can be generated. A transfinite interpolator is included to show when interpolation works and doesn't work.

Some examples from the book using 21x21 points on a unit domain:
